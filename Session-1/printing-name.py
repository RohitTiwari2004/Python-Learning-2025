# IN Python, it is not necessary to define and declare the variable

name=("Rohit")
print(name) 
#Python is based on dynamic typing where we do not use datatype to define the variable

#Python is also known as dynamic binding as its variable is not fixed.
#lets suppose, here a=10 and a="rohit", we can use same variable to define the variable's items. Python Interpreter automatically understands variable's data type.

#stylish declaration techniques
# a=b=c=5
#print(a,b,c)
#outcomes = 5 5 5
